methods: "A stochastic, age-structured compartmental model that explicitly integrates behavioral changes through a new compartment of susceptible individuals who are risk averse."
data_inputs: "Weekly incident flu hospitalizations, contact matrices from Mistry et al. (2021), Prem et al (2017)"
methods_long: "FluBcast is a compartmental behavioral feedback model that simulates the feedback loop by explicitly representing different behavioral classes within the population. Specifically, it is a stochastic, age-structured compartmental model that integrates behavioral changes through a new compartment of risk-averse susceptible individuals."
