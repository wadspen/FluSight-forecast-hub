designated_model: true
methods: "A beta-version of PROF, for testing new features in a prospective forecasting environment. This model adds compartments for vaccinated subjects to the existing PROF methodology."
data_inputs: "Daily and weekly incident flu hospitalizations from the HHS COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries. US Census population estimates. Previous season vaccination time-series from CDC/NCIRD."
methods_long: "The PROF routines perform a deterministic fit of our compartmental SIR[H]2 model to daily hospitalization incidence profiles. The model includes a hospitalization compartment which is split into two sub-compartments. This split ensures that the model preserves the correct generation time (Tg) and that the ratio between cumulative recovered and hospitalized individuals is determined by the infection-hospitalization-ratio. The transmission-rate coefficient (Beta) is a time-dependent function of 2 or more arc-tangents.  The model fit is inferred by an MCMC procedure. It is followed by stochastic simulations through the forecast time-window using the inferred parameter distributions and a daily cadence which is then aggregated to weekly incidence to produce the forecasts.  Where there is little-to-no epi signal in the data, a baseline statistical model is substituted for the mechanistic model.  This model is similar to our standard model 'PSI-PROF', but with the addition of vaccinated compartments for Susceptibles and Infectious, and with deterministic simulations through the forecast time window.
