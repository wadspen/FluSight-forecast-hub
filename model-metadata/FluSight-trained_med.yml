methods_long: "The Hubverse package hubEnsembles is used to generate the ensemble forecast. A weighted median of quantile outputs is used for all eligible quantile-based forecasts with submissions during the prior six weeks. Weights were calculated using a sigmoidal transformation of the forecastsâ€™ relative weighted interval score with respect to the baseline forecast during the prior six weeks. The weight for included forecasts was limited to 0.3."
