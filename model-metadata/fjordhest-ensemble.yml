designated_model: true
data_inputs: US Department of Health and Human Services, COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries
methods: An inverse-WIS weighted ensemble of 3 component models - a compartmental model, a quantile AR model, and a baseline model of random walk with drift. 
methods_long: The mechanistic model is a stochastic SEIR model, with a sequential Monte Carlo based inference. Quantile autoregression model uses quantgen R package, and is similar to CMU-Timeseries model from 2022/23 season. Random walk model uses fable R package. To build an ensemble, the quantile distributions of the component models are weighted (location- and target-specific) by the mean of inverse-WIS scores over the last 3 weeks that could be evaluated. The estimates are solely the responsibility of the contributors and do not represent, nor are endorsed by, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
