designated_model: true
methods: "This approach uses multiple forecasting models as gradient boosting, decision trees, and other machine learning techniques, to generate predictions by combining insights from each model."
data_inputs: "The data inputs consist of historical datasets and target data. Using these, predictions are made by integrating the outputs of the various models in the ensemble."
methods_long: "We employ a combination of multiple forecasting models—such as gradient boosting, decision trees, and ARIMA models—using ensemble techniques to achieve final predictions. By analyzing all available historical data, we generate comprehensive five-week forecasts that reflect a synthesis of each model's strengths."
