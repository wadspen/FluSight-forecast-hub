methods_long: "Optim-WISE is an ensemble forecasting model that learns optimal weights for combining quantile forecasts from five models by minimizing the Weighted Interval Score (WIS) over recent training weeks (upto 4 weeks). It uses optimization with regularization to ensure stable weights, producing a final probabilistic forecast tailored to each location and forecast horizon."
